👋 **Intro**:  
**Hello world! I’m GoldThruster**.  
In the case you are curios as me, and you'd like to now how I came up with this nickname, well...  
I basically though to the most stupid thing for a name possible 😂 => "Thruster"🚀  
And then, though I need to give myself some value too, not just show my dumbness 😅 => "Gold"🥇

🦸‍♂️ **Real life**:  
In real life I'm just an italian(🇮🇹) **teenager/student** who likes to code in his freetime 
and start many (like **a lot**) projects which will never met their end 😅.  
But I love to expirement around and have **fun in process**, the result doesn't matter.

📚 **Experience**:  
I've **experiment around** with many languages (confident in the bold ones): 
- **C#** (Unity, CLI)
- C++ (CLI)
- Scala (CLI)
- Nim (CLI)
- **Javascript** (Site, Server)
- Typescript (Server, CLI)

But none of them satisfies me completely, so **I'd like to create my own** 🤪.
