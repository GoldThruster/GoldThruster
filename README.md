👋 **Intro**:  
Hello world! I’m @GoldThruster.  
In the case you are curios as me, and you'd like to now how I came up with this nickname, well...
I basically though to the most stupid thing for a name possible => "Thruster"
And then, though I need to give myself some value too, not jsut show my dumbness => "Gold"

🦸‍♂️ **Real life**:  
In real life I'm just a teenager/student who likes to code in his freetime 
and start many (like many many) projects which will never met their end 😅.  
But I love to expirement around and have fun in process, the result doesn't matter.

📚 **Experience**:
I've experiment around with many languages:
- C# (Unity. and CLI)
- C++ (CLI)
- Scala (CLI)
- Nim (CLI)
- Javascript (Web)
- Typescript (Web, CLI)
